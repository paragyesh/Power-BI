Leveraging complex parameters, filters, and slicers, users can drill down into specific aspects of the data to extract meaningful insights. By establishing connections, joining tables, and implementing calculations, we've ensured robust data manipulation capabilities. Our dashboard incorporates a diverse range of visualizations including bar charts, pie charts, donut charts, clustered bar charts, scatter charts, line charts, area charts, maps, and slicers, providing users with versatile tools to explore and understand the online sales landscape effectively.
